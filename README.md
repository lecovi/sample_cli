# Sample Python CLI

Sample repository for creating a CLI in Python.

## Motivation

This repository is for educational purposes. I want to show how to create an executable 
CLI tool written in Python. With this I wanna cover:

[ ] Creating a Python Package using traditional `setup.py`.
[ ] Creating a Python Package using `poetry`.
[ ] Publishing to PyPI.
[ ] Creating a simple CLI tool that installs on to your system and is executable.
[ ] Creating plugins for the CLI tool that are *pipinstalable*.
